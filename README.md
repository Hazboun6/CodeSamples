# Code Samples for PsrSigSim

This is a collection of code snippets for the __Pulsar Signal Simulator__.

This space is for testing, discussing, and brainstorming.
As things mature, they should be moved to the [VersionZeroPointZero](https://github.com/PsrSigSim/VersionZeroPointZero) repository.

## Code and Edit Style

 * __Document your code__ - use comments and doc strings so others can follow along
 * __Be bold__ - add code, change code, combine code... it's early in the project, and this space is for brainstorming
 * __Commit often__ - keep commits small (one commit for one change in functionality), it's easier to roll back and cherry-pick changes as needed
 * __Write Python 3.x code__ - for compatibility use the `__future__` module in __all__ files<br>
```python
from __future__ import (absolute_import, division,
                        print_function, unicode_literals)
```

 * __think about structure and style__ - [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) are good places to start
